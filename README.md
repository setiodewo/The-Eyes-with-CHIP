# The-Eyes-with-CHIP
Simple program to display eyes controlled with buttons

The Eyes was inspired from an Arduino Project by Paco SG. This is a similar program with CHIP and CHIPOLED Shield. I made the eyes can be controlled by buttons.

The inspiration comes from: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/francisco.sanchezguzman.9/videos/10214825524127090/?permPage=1&amp;ifg=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paco SG &gt; Arduino Projects</a>.
